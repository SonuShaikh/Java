  public static void main(String[] args){
	  /* BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
	  int i;
	  for(;i = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());System.out.println(i))

	   System.out.print(1+2+"="+1+2);
  }
}

The First part of print i.e 1+2 . + operator is used to performed Arithmatic Addition operation. Thats why 1+2 became 3. Next part print is String i.e "=" . When we used + operator with String it will performed as Concatination operation. i.e combining two string. "="+1+2 it give =12.
